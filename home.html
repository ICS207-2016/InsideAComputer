		<h2>Parts and Their Functions</h2> 
		<h3 id = "ROM" > ROM </h3> 
		<p>  The ROM (read-only memory) stores programs and software instructions in electronic devices as well as performing major input and output tasks. It is a type of memory storage system that can only be read and not changed. </p>
	<h3 id = "RAM" > RAM </h3> 
	<p>  Random Access Memory (RAM) allows information to be stored and retrieved on a computer. This temporary memory is not saved when the computer is turned off. RAM is measured in megabytes and gigabytes. </p> 
<h3 id = "NetworkCard" > Network Card </h3>
<p> The network card allows your computer to communicate over a network and access the Internet. It can connect to the internet with an ethernet cable or through a wireless connection (Wi-Fi).</p> 
<h3 id = "HardDrive" > Hard Drive </h3>
<p> The hard drive stores all the information on your computer. This data is permanent, meaning it wonâ€™t be lost when the computer is turned off. </p> 
<h3 id = "HeatingSink" > Heating Sink </h3> 
<p>  A heat sink transfers the heat generated by an electronic or a mechanical device in a computer to a fluid medium, often air or a liquid coolant, where it is taken away, neutrailizing the computers temperature in order to prevent overheating.</p> 	
<h3 id = "PowerSupply" > Power Supply </h3>
<p> The power supply converts the power from the wall outlet to the type of power needed by the computer in order to run. It sends power through cables to different components of the computer. </p>
<h3 id = "FloppyDiskDrive" > Floppy Disk Drive </h3>
<p> The floppy drive is a piece of computer hardware that reads data from, and writes data to, a small disk.</p> 
<h3 id = "Fan" > Fan </h3>
<p> The fan prevents the CPU from overheating. Cooling fans bring cool air into the computer, transfer hot air out of the computer. </p>	
<h3 id = "CPU" > CPU </h3>
<p> The CPU runs a series of stored instructions (also known as a program). This program will take input from an input device, process the input and output the results to an output device.</p> 	
<h3 id = "VideoCard" > Video Card </h3>
<p> A video card (also known as a graphics card) is connected to the motherboard and generates what you see on the computer. Video cards include a processing unit, memory, a cooling mechanism and connections to a display device. </p> 	
<h3 id = "VideoCardSlot" > Video Card Slot </h3>
<p> Allows video card to be inserted into the computer IDK HELP ME. </p>	
<h3 id= "RAMSlot" > RAM Slot </h3> 
<p> RAM slot is what allows computer memory (RAM) to be inserted into the computer. </p>
<h3 id = "CDSlot" > CD Slot </h3>
<p>  Reads disks IDK EITHER HELP. </p>
<h3 id = "Ports" > Ports </h3>  
<p>  A port is a hole or connection found on the front or back of a computer which connect external devices to the computer. </p>
